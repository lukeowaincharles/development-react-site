        "The St Andrews Links Collegiate tournament brings together four of the top university golf teams from around the world to compete on the historic courses of St Andrews, the home of golf.",
        "Over three days, I immersed myself in the rich history and breathtaking beauty of St Andrews. From the iconic Swilcan Bridge to the challenging fairways and greens, I photographed the stunning Jubilee and Old course along with the talented golfers who graced the grounds. I captured the intensity of competition, the camaraderie among players, and the sheer joy of playing golf on such hallowed turf.",
        "Here are a small selection from those three days."
